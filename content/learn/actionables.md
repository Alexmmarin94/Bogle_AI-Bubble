# Bogle Portfolio Actionables 
## (Bogle-compatible decisions you can actually implement)

> **Timestamp disclaimer:** this page was written in **January 2026**. The actionable framework stays the same, but you should re-check the latest data if you’re reading this much later. ([Bogleheads: Asset allocation][1])

This tab translates the app’s indicator framework into **practical portfolio decisions** that remain broadly consistent with Boglehead principles. The intent is **not** to “time the market,” but to define **guardrails** and **coarse adjustments** that help reduce avoidable behavioral mistakes during unusual regimes. ([Bogleheads: Asset allocation][1])

## 1) The main dial: how much fixed income (bonds) to hold

In a Bogle-style portfolio, the single most important decision is usually **your stock/bond mix** (plus cash for near-term needs). That mix is normally driven by:
- time horizon,
- tolerance for drawdowns,
- and the need for liquidity. ([Bogleheads: Asset allocation][1])

### Why bonds can be *more* attractive than you planned (in some regimes)
Even if you’re in an accumulation phase (typically equity-heavy), there are environments where holding **a bit more bonds/cash than your baseline** can be rational without becoming a market timer:
- when financial conditions tighten and the probability of large equity drawdowns rises,
- when rate volatility is elevated,
- or when concentration risks become unusually high and you want stronger “ballast.” ([Bogleheads: Asset allocation][1])

**Bogle-compatible way to do it:** define a **baseline** allocation and a small **band** around it (e.g., ±5–10 percentage points). Only move inside that band when multiple “stress/conditions” indicators align for a sustained period, and rebalance back toward baseline when conditions normalize. ([Bogleheads: Asset allocation][1])

## 2) What kind of bonds to hold (duration, quality, and geography)

Bonds are not a single thing. Your bond block has three big choices:

### 2.1 Duration (short vs intermediate vs long)
- **Duration** is the key concept for interest-rate sensitivity: higher duration means bond prices move more when yields move. ([Bogleheads: Bond basics][2])
- Long-duration bond funds can be much more volatile. A common Bogle-style preference is to emphasize **high-quality, intermediate-term** exposure unless you have a specific liability-matching reason. ([Bogleheads: Bond basics][2])

**Actionable (within Bogle guardrails):**
- If the regime suggests high rate uncertainty, tilt the bond block toward **short/intermediate duration**.
- If yields fall materially and risk rises (classic “flight-to-quality”), high-quality bonds often behave as stabilizers—duration can help, but it comes with higher volatility. ([Bogleheads: Bond basics][2])

### 2.2 Quality (Treasuries vs investment-grade vs high-yield)
- High-quality government bonds are typically the “ballast” people mean in Bogle portfolios.
- Credit-heavy bond funds add equity-like risk in disguise (spreads widen in stress). This is not “bad,” but it changes the role of bonds in your portfolio. ([Bogleheads: Bond basics][2])

**Actionable:**
- In stress regimes, bias toward **high-quality government / investment-grade** rather than reaching for yield.

### 2.3 Inflation protection (TIPS / inflation-linked bonds)
Inflation-linked bonds (e.g., U.S. **TIPS**) are designed to reduce unexpected inflation risk by adjusting principal and interest with inflation measures. ([Bogleheads: TIPS][3])

**Actionable:**
- If inflation uncertainty is unusually high, consider allocating **part** of the bond block to inflation-linked bonds (e.g., a minority slice). Keep it as a risk-management choice, not as a precise inflation forecast. ([Bogleheads: How to build a lazy portfolio][4])

### 2.4 Geography / currency (U.S., Eurozone, hedged vs unhedged)
For many non-U.S. investors, bond currency exposure can dominate outcomes. A common approach is:
- hold bonds in (or hedged to) the currency that matches your spending needs,
- treat equities as the global risk engine. ([Bogleheads: Stock allocation for non-US investors][5])

**Actionable:**
- If you live/spend in EUR, it’s often reasonable to anchor a large part of the bond block in EUR (or EUR-hedged) high-quality bonds.
- If you’re U.S.-based, U.S. Treasuries / broad U.S. bond funds are the default anchor.

## 3) Contributions: DCA vs “slump dump” vs “wait and invest later”

### Core principle: DCA is a behavior tool, not a return maximizer
Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) reduces the emotional burden of investing during volatile periods, but it can leave money on the sidelines.

Vanguard’s research comparing lump-sum investing vs cost averaging found that **lump-sum investing historically outperformed cost averaging about two-thirds of the time**, largely because markets drift upward more often than not. ([Vanguard: Cost averaging paper][6]) ([Vanguard: LSI vs CA explainer][7])

### What this means for “special situations” (without turning into market timing)
Instead of trying to call the bottom, use a rule-based choice:

**Option A — Baseline DCA (default):**
- Keep your normal monthly/weekly contributions regardless of noise.

**Option B — Structured “slump dump” (only under guardrails):**
- If the app flags a high-stress regime and you hold extra cash intentionally,
- deploy that cash in **predefined tranches** (e.g., 25% now, 25% after X weeks, etc.).
This is not about predicting bottoms; it’s about committing to a plan before emotions spike.

**Option C — Contribute less now, more later:**
- This is the most “timing-like” choice and should be rare.
- If you do it, require stronger evidence and time limits (e.g., “for 4 weeks only”) because otherwise it becomes indefinite procrastination. ([Vanguard: Cost averaging paper][6])

## 4) A non-core “real assets” sleeve (gold as the simple example)

Boglehead portfolios often avoid commodities and gold, but some investors choose a small allocation as an **insurance-like diversifier**.

The Bogleheads wiki covers practical holding methods and cautions (volatility, no cash flow, long flat periods). ([Bogleheads: Gold][8])

**Bogle-compatible framing:**
- Do not treat gold (or any non-core real asset) as a required return engine.
- Treat it as an **optional sleeve** whose size reflects your comfort with macro tail risks.

**Actionable:**
- Decide whether you want **0%** or a **small capped range** (e.g., 0–5% or 0–10% depending on personal preference).
- Rebalance mechanically (e.g., annually) rather than chasing narratives. ([Bogleheads: Gold][8])

> Note: this app does **not** recommend specific non-core alternatives. It only helps you decide whether your *personal* target range for a non-core sleeve should be higher or lower given uncertainty and your risk tolerance.

## 5) The “VTI + VXUS + BND” style portfolio: what can you actually change?

This is the classic “three-fund portfolio” implementation (or close variants). ([Bogleheads: Three-fund portfolio][9])

### 5.1 The VTI/VXUS ratio (U.S. vs international equities)
Bogleheads discussions emphasize that domestic/international splits are a **policy choice**, not a prediction, and there are multiple reasonable anchors:
- market-cap weight (global market portfolio),
- a fixed home bias,
- or a split chosen for rebalancing behavior and comfort. ([Bogleheads: Domestic/international][10])

**Actionable:**
- Choose a **policy ratio** (e.g., market-weight-ish vs home-biased) and allow only small deviations (e.g., ±5–10 percentage points of equities) when the app flags sustained concentration/leadership risk.
- If you’re tempted to swing big based on headlines, that’s a sign to tighten guardrails, not loosen them. ([Bogleheads: Domestic/international][10])

### 5.2 BND (bond fund): duration and inflation protection
If your bond block is a broad bond fund, your main “knobs” are:
- complementing with TIPS (partial),
- shifting duration (short/intermediate/long) if your fund lineup allows it,
- keeping quality high in stress. ([Bogleheads: Bond basics][2]) ([Bogleheads: TIPS][3])

## 6) European robo-advisors and UCITS “one-fund” solutions: what changes, what doesn’t

### 6.1 Robo-advisors (Europe)
**Advantages**
- automated rebalancing,
- behavior support (“stay invested”),
- simple execution.

**Disadvantages**
- you may have less control over bond geography, duration, and inflation-linking,
- and sometimes higher all-in fees than DIY index funds.

**Actionables available**
- mostly **risk level** (which maps to stock/bond mix),
- sometimes regional tilt (limited),
- and contribution pacing.

### 6.2 Single global equity fund (e.g., MSCI ACWI / FTSE All-World)
**Advantages**
- maximum simplicity,
- minimal decision surface,
- very hard to “mess up.”

**Disadvantages**
- you inherit concentration and regional weights by construction,
- the main lever becomes the bond/cash side. ([Bogleheads: Asset allocation][1])

**Actionables available**
- primarily stock/bond/cash mix,
- and whether to add a small non-core sleeve.

## 7) Summary: which portfolios have which “real” actionables?

### A) US DIY (VTI + VXUS + BND)
**Most flexible**
- Stock/bond mix
- VTI/VXUS split (within policy guardrails)
- Bond duration / TIPS slice (if available)
- Optional small non-core sleeve  
([Bogleheads: Three-fund portfolio][9])

### B) EU robo-advisor
**Behaviorally strong, less flexible**
- Mostly stock/bond risk level
- Contribution rate
- Sometimes limited regional adjustments

### C) One-fund global equity (ACWI/All-World) + a bond fund
**Simplest**
- Stock/bond mix dominates
- Contributions and rebalancing discipline
- Optional capped non-core sleeve  
([Bogleheads: Asset allocation][1])

## Final note: “not market timing,” but still “fine-tuning”
The moment you start “hilar fino,” you risk drifting into timing. The antidote is:
- small bands, not big swings,
- multiple-signal confirmation,
- and time-based re-checks (weekly/monthly), not daily reactions. ([Bogleheads: Asset allocation][1])
